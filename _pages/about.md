## Changelog 1.0


I've been developing software for 10 years. I started as an Email Marketing coder, moving onto Front-End Website development. Through the years I trained myself into Javascript and moved onto NodeJS as a Fullstack developer. 

I've also specialized in Email Development and Marketing, using systems such as Experian Cheetahmail, SalesForce Exact Target, Campaign Monitor and MailChimp. Along with building customized microsites and campaigns for some of the biggest companies in New Zealand.
