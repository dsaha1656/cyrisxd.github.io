## Microsite

This is an entirely custom build that required itâ€™s own admin system to manage prizes, expiry, play limits, and more.

Users had to be preloaded into an admin system, which generated a GUID and link for each user. These links were then used in a targetted eDM towards the customers with a call to action to play the game and win prizes.

From the ground up it was built with:

* HTML
* CSS3
* Javascript
* NodeJS (Backend)
* Firebase/Firestore (Database)

<a href="#" class="button button--large" target="_blank" disabled>Site unavailable</a>
